# Projekt_OOP
 A program that tells you whether a point is inside or outside a figure.
 
 It also tells you how many points you get if the point is inside or outside a figure.
 
 I have lost the scoring system :(.

 ## Prerequisites

 To be able to run the program you need to install the .NET framework.

 It shouldn't matter which version you get, as long as it is .NET 5.0 or a later version.

 For installation and setup, select your Windows version so you can find the correct guide: [Installation Guides Based On Windows Version](https://learn.microsoft.com/sv-se/dotnet/framework/install/)

 All version of .NET: [All versions of .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)

 Specifically .NET 5.0, if you so desire: [.NET 5.0 framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0)

 ## Install and Run

 This part continues on the assumption that you have the prerequisites.

 1. Download the files or copy the repository

 2. Search for "cmd" (command prompt) on your PC (computer).

 3. Change the directory to the this repository (or folder with the files if you selectively downloaded).

  In between comment here. If you are not familiar `cd`, follow this: [cd command Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cd-cmd-command/) 

 4. Run the command `csc Program.cs`

 5. Enjoy the game!
